class HiddenStateRollingBuffer(torch.nn.Module):
    """
    Stores EAGLE hidden state in a rolling buffer with simple storage/access.

    The primary purpose of this class is to support batched asynchronous
    execution of EAGLE speculative decoding.

    When using EAGLE speculation, each decode step requires that the prior
    iteration hidden_state output  is used in the current iteration forward
    pass.

    During batched asynchronous execution, it is possible that a currently
    executing speculative decode step is interrupted because a new context
    encoding is scheduled to begin. This means that rather than storing a single
    hidden state, we must store at least 2. The extra hidden state allows us to
    restart the prior decode step by rolling the hidden_state back to the last
    iteration. To simplify the implementation of this, we simply store
    `buffer_length` steps which can be stored and retrieved on-demand.

    The hidden state retrieved for a particular position_id is the respective prev_hidden_state
    for EAGLE. This means that `set_state` should be called with the `next_position_ids` and `get_state`
    should be called with the current `position_ids`.

    In EAGLE speculation, `buffer_length` should be set to `k * 2` so that any
    speculated position is accessible within 2 iterations.
